description: Audit and improve Azure DevOps work item quality across iterations. Use when asked to review work items for missing/inadequate descriptions, vague titles, area path violations, removed items in active iterations, or general board hygiene. Also use when asked to do a "health check" or "hygiene audit" of work items.

# Work Item Hygiene

Audit work items across active iterations for quality, completeness, and consistency. Present findings for review rather than auto-fixing — the Supreme Commander decides what to change.

## Audit Workflow

### 1. Identify Iterations to Audit

Query active iterations using `work_list_iterations` or `work_list_team_iterations`. Typically audit:
- Current support iteration
- Current and recent project iterations

### 2. Fetch All Work Items

Use WIQL to query items in target iterations:

```wiql
SELECT [System.Id]
FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.IterationPath] UNDER '{iteration}'
ORDER BY [System.WorkItemType], [System.Id]
```

Then batch-fetch with `wit_get_work_items_batch_by_ids` including fields:
- `System.Id`, `System.Title`, `System.WorkItemType`, `System.State`
- `System.Description`, `System.AreaPath`, `System.IterationPath`, `System.Parent`
- `Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps` (for Bugs)

### 3. Run Health Checks

Check each item against these criteria:

**Area path**: Must match parent PBI's area path. Root-level project paths are almost always wrong — items should be under a child area path (e.g. `Project\FeatureArea`).

**Title quality**: Should be specific and actionable. "Create templates" is vague; "Create attendance email templates and enum values" is clear.

**Description presence**: Every item needs a description. Note: `System.Description` is a long-text field — cannot query `= ''` in WIQL. Must batch-fetch and check programmatically.

**Description quality**: Not just present but adequate. A one-liner like "Needs to be added" is not adequate for a PBI. Descriptions should explain the what and why.

**Bug description field**: Bugs render `Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps`, NOT `System.Description`. Always check and write to `ReproSteps` for Bugs. Content in `System.Description` on a Bug is invisible in the UI.

**Removed/duplicate items**: Items marked Removed should not remain in active iterations — move to Archive.

**State consistency**: Done items should have descriptions too (for historical reference).

### 4. Present Findings

Present findings to the Supreme Commander grouped by severity:
- **Fix immediately**: Area path violations, wrong description field (Bug in System.Description)
- **Review together**: Missing descriptions, inadequate descriptions, vague titles
- **Discuss**: Removed items, scope questions, items that may need reclassification

Go through items one-by-one rather than in tables — tables don't render well for review.

### 5. Apply Fixes

After the Supreme Commander approves each fix:
- Update via `wit_update_work_item` or `wit_update_work_items_batch`
- Write descriptions back to the Supreme Commander for eyeballing before moving on
- Use batch updates where multiple items need the same type of fix (e.g. area path corrections)

## Description Writing Conventions

### PBIs and Bugs (stakeholder-friendly)
- Describe the **what** and **why** — stakeholders may read these
- Use plain language, avoid implementation jargon
- Structure with `<br><br>` for paragraph breaks, `<ul><li>` for lists, `<b>` for emphasis
- For Bugs, use `<h2>` sections: Problem, Root Cause, Fix

### Tasks (implementation-oriented)
- Describe the **how** — these are for developers
- Can reference code, resolvers, handlers by name
- Include technical context that helps future-you understand the work

### Verification Tasks
- Explain what is being verified and **why** it matters
- Include a **Result** section with the finding

### Work Item References
Always use rich links in descriptions, never plain `#123`:
```html
<a href="https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_workitems/edit/{id}/" data-vss-mention="version:1.0">#{id}</a>
```

## Gotchas

- `System.Description` is not rendered for Bug work items — use `Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps`
- `System.Description` is a long-text field — cannot query `= ''` or check length in WIQL
- `System.Parent` field on `wit_create_work_item` doesn't reliably create hierarchy links — use `wit_work_items_link` separately
- When using MCP tools, `\n` is fine for line breaks but `\n\n` gets double-escaped — use `<br>` or `<div>` for HTML descriptions
- PR/task titles sometimes drift from actual scope during implementation — check titles match what was done, not what was planned
